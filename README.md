# Azure Instance Metadata Service Emulator
Simplifies development of services hosted on Azure VMs by allowing developers to emulate the IMDS service.

For more information about IMDS please see: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/instance-metadata-service

I'm mostly interested in emulating the token api for now but may add others in the future.
